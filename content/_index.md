# Welcome
Hello, I'm **Oscar Topliss**.

I'm a second year **BSc Cyber Security** student at **The University of Warwick** and a bit of a nerd
with a particular love for **reverse engineering**, **programming**, and **cryptography**.


For a bit more about who I am and what I do, see **[About Me](about-me/)**

I'm happy to provide **references** and a **CV** on request, please email me at <oscartopliss@gmail.com>
