# Academic Projects
Some of the projects I've worked on as part of my degree.

This isn't an exhaustive list, but it's a few I think are the most interesting:

- [Linux Virtual File System Report](./less-bashrc)
- [Cryptographic System Design and Implementation](./cryptographic-system)


## System Design
I designed the system with a few key things in mind:
- I wanted the program to be able to handle **multiple user sessions
concurrently**.
- I needed strong **encryption at rest** and **in transit** to ensure the
**Confidentiality**, **Integrity** and **Non-Repudiation** of data.
