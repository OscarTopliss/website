title: "Linux Virtual Filesystem Report"

# Operating Systems Coursework
I completed this report as part of my first year Operating Systems module.

It was an analysis of what actually happens when a user enters the following
into a terminal:
```bash
less .bashrc
```

Most of my report focuses on the Linux virtual file system, and how files are
handled both as part of the filesystem as a whole, and on a per-process basis
when a process needs access to the file. The rest of the report covers some
basic operating system concepts, including process memory isolation and
syscalls.

I hugely enjoyed this coursework, Operating Systems and Linux espeically
fascinate me, and I really enjoyed learning a lot more about Linux's inner
workings. The Linux Virtual File System in particular is an incredibly
interesting peice of software, and one I hope to explore more in the future.

I achieved a grade of **81%** for this coursework.
