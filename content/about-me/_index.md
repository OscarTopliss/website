# About Me

## Summary
I'm an undergraduate cyber security student. I love all aspects of computer
science and security, but I tend to specialise in the following areas:
- **[Reverse Engineering](./reverse-engineering/)**

- **Programming**: I have extensive experience programming
in Python, quite a bit in Java, and some in C.

- **Cryptography**: Mostly through my university studies
I've written about, researched and implemented a number of different 
cryptographic systems.

### **PwC Security Architecture Work Experience** | _2024_
In August 2024 I spent a week **shadowing** PwC's **Security Architecture and
Engineering** team in London.

Each day I shadowed a different member of the team, and got to understand a 
bit more about the kinds of work which go into architecture consultancy.
During the week I was given a number of tasks related to the consultancy
projects the team was completing at the time.

Whenever I had free time I'd go and speak to members of as many other security
teams as I could. This both taught me a lot about how different roles and 
disciplines work together within cyber security, and gave me a lot more 
confidence communicating with new people in a professional environment.

### **Tutoring** | _2025_
In 2025 I tutored A-Level computer science. I hugely enjoy teaching, especially
helping my student to develop programmatic thinking skills, and providing context
on topics the A-Level specifications don't cover.
