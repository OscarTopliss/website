# Reverse Engineering
Since 2024 I've done a lot of **reverse engineering** and **binary
exploitation** (aka "**pwn**") challenges in my free time.

---
## Architectures
Most of the reverse engineering challenges have focused on **x86** and
**x86\_64** executables, usually targeting Linux.

As a result I'm proficient in reading and understanding assembly to
understand disassembled x86/64 programs.

---
## Static Analysis
I've done a lot of **static analysis** for various **capture the flag**
projects, I have experience in Ghidra and IDA but now tend to prefer Binary
Ninja.

Most of the projects I've completed have required analysing programs
originally written in **C**. As a result I've become proficient in analysing
C-based programs via decompilation and disassembly. I
have some limited experience reverse engineering programs written in **C++**.

---
## Dynamic Analysis/Debugging
I use **gdb** and **radare2** for dynamic analysis, most often for binary
exploitation challenges.
